# Xfr-Sv
On the comparison between (explanation) feature relevancy, as measured by AXp and CXp, and SHAP scores 
(computed using Lundberg's SHAP tool or Barcelo's algorithms).

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the project dependencies.

## Description

1. `models` contains all the tested d-DNNFs/DTs/MDDs.
2. `samples` contains all the tested points.
3. `shap_scores` contains the computed SHAP scores.
4. `classifiers` contains the d-DNNF/MDD classifiers.
5. `Xplainer` contains the logical explainer script.
6. `LXp_ddnnf.py` and `LXp_mdd.py` implement the logical explainer for d-DNNFs/MDDs.
7. `SHAPddnnf` and `SHAPmdd` implement the computation of exact SHAP scores for d-DNNFs/MDDs.
8. `useSHAP_ddnnf.py` invokes Lundberg's SHAP tool to compute SHAP scores for d-DNNFs.
9. The `exactSHAPscore.py` script computes the exact SHAP scores for d-DNNFs/MDDs.
10. The `compRank.py` script compares and plots the feature importance ranks generated by Lundberg's SHAP scores and Barcelo's exact SHAP scores. 
11. The scripts `Irr-Rel-SHAP.py` plots the number of instances where irrelevant features have greater (in absolute value) SHAP scores than relevant features.
